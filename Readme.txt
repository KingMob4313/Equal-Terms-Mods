--= Equal Terms Modification for Open-X-Com =--
By KingMob4313 and Ickschuss. Created for X-Com: Ufo Defense May 2000.
Last updated Oct 2014.

Version 2.000

Installation: unzip the package to your OpenXcom directory and answer yes to the overwrites (if needed).

There are now five main rulesets included in each package: 
1) Three (3) for the main mods, containing modded info for all three tiers 
2) A ruleset that adjusts the accuracy of aliens to make up for the changed accuracies of plasma weapons
3) A miscellaneous ruleset with a small number of non-essential changes to related to the mod 
4) A number of optional rulesets
  A) A ruleset that completely removes the psi amp
    I) There will be enhanced armor that provides psi strength at a cost to view and accuracy
  B) A ruleset that makes blaster bombs only usable by aliens and human HWPs
    I) There will be elerium warhead rockets for the rocket launcher as a replacement
  
The mod has three portions:

-= Wolfram Lance =-
Named after the German name for tungsten, since the gunpowder weapons all use tungsten-carbide as penetrators.  Gunpowder weapons lack damage potential compared to later weapon technologies, but still have the highest cyclic rates in the game; firing more rounds per time-unit than other weapon classes.

-= Coherency =- 
Laser weapons, while more potent and much more accurate in autofire modes than gunpowder weapons, are inferior in aimed accuracy to other weapon classes and lack the lethality of plasma weapons.

-= Fourth State =- 
Plasma is the fourth state of matter, and the Plasma weapons inflict incomparable damage, while lacking some of the accuracy or rate of fire compared to the other weapon types

Overall, weapons have a certain amount of utility throughout the game, while still making upgrading technology levels worthwhile.  Because of this, researching the weapon technology trees now takes longer, to afford more utility to the earlier tiers.

Fix all tanks to use the correct format for the YAML:

    a) First weapon(item) should match the name of the tank
	  i) Weapon and ammo do not belong in the builtInWeapons section(see below)
	b) Aux weapon and ammo should be on in the 'builtInWeapons:' section
  2) 'fixedWeapon:' on the weapon(item)
  3) turretType: on the main weapon(item)
  4) 'allowInv: false' on the armor
  5) Comment out ammo UFOpedia entries and bigobs

[Rejected] This has been a massive issue with my high accuracy weapons, that they tend to do great in anyone's hands... and I've been trying to think of ways of solving it.  But you mentioning it here will really set me to work tomorrow.  Back to Excel. I'm thinking of having the Sniper Rifle at 200% accuracy, but drops by a huge amount at range, like around 7-12?   The big thing about the sniper rifle is that honestly, at the ranges shown visually in the game, no one would need more than an ACOG (low magnification of around 1.5 to 2) type sight for high accuracy work...

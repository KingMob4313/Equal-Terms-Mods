There are now four rulesets included in each package: 
1-3) Three for the main mods, containing modded info for all three tiers 
  4) A miscellaneous ruleset 
    a) this contains small changes to related to the mod 
    b) adjusts the accuracy of aliens to make up for the changed accuracies of plasma weapons
	c) adds an item to the alien base map

== Required 'Advanced'/'Mods' settings == 
'UFO Extender accuracy' - Range Based Accuracy is an ABSOLUTE NECESSITY for proper balance.

-- Suggested Settings --
Explosion Height 3

NOTE: 
HWPs are only partially tested.

The mod has three portions:

-= Wolfram Lance =-
Named after the German name for tungsten, since the gunpowder weapons all use tungsten-carbide as penetrators.  Gunpowder weapons lack damage potential compared to later weapon technologies, but still have the highest cyclic rates in the game; firing more rounds per time-unit than other weapon classes.

-= Coherency =- 
Laser weapons, while more potent and much more accurate in autofire modes than gunpowder weapons, are inferior in aimed accuracy to other weapon classes and lack the lethality of plasma weapons.

-= Fourth State =- 
Plasma is the fourth state of matter, and the Plasma weapons inflict incomparable damage, while lacking some of the accuracy or rate of fire compared to the other weapon types

Overall, weapons have a certain amount of utility throughout the game, while still making upgrading technology levels worthwhile.  Because of this, researching the weapon technology trees now takes longer, to afford more utility to the earlier tiers.

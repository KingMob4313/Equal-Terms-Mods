--= 313 Equal Terms Modification for Open-X-Com =--
By KingMob4313 and Ickschuss. Created for X-Com: Ufo Defense May 2000.
Last updated August 2014.

Current Version: 1.0

Installation: unzip the package to your OpenXcom directory and answer yes to the overwrites (if needed).

NOTE: THIS MOD SUPPRESSES THE NORMAL HUMAN WEAPONS FROM BEING AVAILABLE AND ADDS THE NEW VERSIONS TO THE GAME.

Concept:

The purpose of this modification is give players starting weapons with real life equivalents, ie: weapons UN forces would be using against these UFO attacks.  The starting human weapons have been replaced with the following: a 5.7mm machine pistol, a 6.8mm Assault Rifle, a Squad Automatic Weapon, and a .50 calibre Anti-Materiel Sniper rifle. There are also new additions of a pump combat shogun, a 9mm submachine gun, a .454 magnum revolver, a 7.62x51mm designated marksman's rifle, a single shot rocket launcher and an incendiary grenade that can be purchased, like all the human weapons and an alloy shogun to be researched later.

There are also two different armors that can be purchased, based on current armor technology.

This patch also increases some explosive damages and tweaks the other weapon damages, accuracies and fire rates for the other weapons to create some sort of game balance. In general, autofire will be much less accurate than before, making aimed and snap shots much more favourable.

This mod requires the range based accuracy mod from UFOextender enabled for proper balance.

-= Change Summary =-
1) Role Based Weaponry: Weapons now favor the roles they are used in combat. For doing entries on a UFO or building, shoguns, SMG and pistols are much more capable weapons than assault and sniper rifles.  In fact, some weapons are inherently more inaccurate at close ranges than medium ranges. At the same time, many weapons suitable for use in entries lack long range capabilities.

2) Weapon Types: Powder weapons fire the most shots in auto and most snap shots of all the weapon damage types.  Lasers have the best accuracy in autofire, at expense of their accuracy in aimed shots. Plasma weapons do the most damage.

3) Autofire is much less accurate than in the base game.  Each weapon firing mode has it's advantages depending on the weapon's role and type. Making single aimed shots with the SAW or snap shots with the Sniper Rifle are not as efficient as using those weapons as they are intended.
